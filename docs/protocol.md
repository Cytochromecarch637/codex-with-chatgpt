# C2C Agent Protocol

Control plane: Computer Use (tiny structured messages typed into the ChatGPT UI).
Data plane: MCP (ChatGPT pulls files, diffs, search results itself).

Never mix the two: control messages carry state, never content.

## States

```
INIT → PLAN → EXECUTING → EXECUTED → REVIEW → PLAN | DONE | BLOCKED | ERROR
```

| State | Sender | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INIT | Codex | New task; asks ChatGPT to inspect + plan |
| PLAN | ChatGPT | Executable plan for the next iteration |
| EXECUTING | Codex | (optional) execution in progress |
| EXECUTED | Codex | Iteration finished; metadata only |
| REVIEW | ChatGPT | (implicit) ChatGPT is inspecting via MCP |
| DONE | ChatGPT | Success criteria met |
| BLOCKED | ChatGPT | Cannot proceed; contains reason |
| ERROR | either | Protocol/infrastructure failure |

## Message format

Every control message starts with `[C2C]` and key-value headers, then sections.
Keep messages < 1 KB. No diffs, no logs, no file bodies.

### INIT (Codex → ChatGPT)

```
[C2C]
STATE: INIT
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 0

GOAL:
Implement dark mode.

INSTRUCTION:
Inspect the connected workspace through Codex with ChatGPT MCP.
Create an implementation plan for Codex.
```

### PLAN (ChatGPT → Codex)

```
[C2C]
STATE: PLAN
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 1

GOAL:
...

RATIONALE:
...

ACTIONS:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

FILES_LIKELY_INVOLVED:
...

TESTS:
...

SUCCESS_CRITERIA:
...
```

Plans must be finite, concrete, executable. Not 40-step epics.

### EXECUTED (Codex → ChatGPT)

```
[C2C]
STATE: EXECUTED
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 1

RESULT:
Execution finished.

CHANGED_FILES:
4

TESTS:
27 passed

Please independently inspect the workspace and current git diff through MCP.
```

Before sending EXECUTED, Codex records the iteration:
`c2c record --task c2c_f81a --iteration 1 --changed-files ... --tests ... --exit-status ok`
so ChatGPT can read it via the `execution_summary` / `test_status` tools.

### DONE / BLOCKED (ChatGPT → Codex)

```
[C2C]
STATE: DONE
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 3

SUMMARY:
...
```

```
[C2C]
STATE: BLOCKED
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 3

REASON:
...

NEEDS:
...
```

## Loop limits

`maxIterations` (default 12, configurable in `.c2c.json`). When reached, Codex
pauses and asks the user whether to continue.

## Boot Prompt

Send once at the start of every new C2C conversation:

```
You are the planning and review layer of a Codex coding session.

Codex owns execution.
You own high-level reasoning, planning and review.

You have access to the current local workspace through the
"Codex with ChatGPT" MCP connector.

Rules:

1. Do not ask Codex to paste files that are available through MCP.
2. Inspect only the files needed for the task.
3. Use MCP to inspect current code, git status and diff.
4. Produce concise executable plans.
5. Codex will execute your plan using its own harness.
6. After Codex reports EXECUTED, independently inspect the diff.
7. Do not assume an implementation succeeded just because Codex says so.
8. Continue until the implementation satisfies the success criteria.
9. Avoid unnecessary rewrites.
10. Return C2C structured control messages.
```
